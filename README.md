YOLOv5 Web Elements Detection

This repository contains code for training a YOLOv5 model to detect various web elements commonly found in user interfaces. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset generated using the provided script.

Dataset

The training dataset used in this project consists of synthetic images of web elements. Due to the unavailability of a suitable real-world dataset, synthetic images were generated using the provided generate_synthetic_images function. Each class of web element has been assigned a distinct color for visualization purposes.

Synthetic Dataset Generation

The generate_synthetic_images function creates synthetic images of web elements with random sizes and positions. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes and class labels corresponding to the type of web element present.

Training

The YOLOv5 model is trained on the synthetic dataset to learn to detect various web elements. Due to the lack of a real-world dataset, the synthetic dataset is used for training. However, it is recommended to replace this dataset with a real-world dataset for optimal performance.

Model Architecture

The YOLOv5 model architecture is employed for object detection tasks. The model is implemented using PyTorch and consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction and detection.

Training Procedure

The training loop iterates over the synthetic dataset, feeding batches of images and labels to the model. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a cross-entropy loss function. Training is performed for a fixed number of epochs.


Training

To train the YOLOv5 model, execute the provided training script train_yolov5.py. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed and that the synthetic dataset is available in the specified directory.


Inference

To perform inference on custom images using the trained model, utilize the detect_objects_and_save function provided in the script. Specify the path to the image, the trained model, and the output path for the annotated image.

Note

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for web elements detection using YOLOv5. For practical applications, it is recommended to train the model on a diverse and representative real-world dataset to achieve optimal performance.
